# SMART_CCTV - For anamaloues activity detection in restricted spaces.
## OpenCV Project

### Introduction
SMART_CCTV is a project aimed at enhancing traditional CCTV systems by integrating advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to provide intelligent surveillance capabilities. This project is currently in development.

### Features
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Using OpenCV for detecting objects in video feeds.
- **Motion Detection:** Highlighting motion in the video stream.
- **Alert System:** Sending notifications when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Video Recording:** Recording video footage for later review.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:** 
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
 
### Future Scope
- Real-time analysis of CCTV activities.
- Accurate detection of activities such as detecting fire, theft, etc.
- Facial recognition for identifying known individuals.
- Integrating with smart home systems for automated responses.
- Data analytics for generating reports on security events.
- Scalability for monitoring multiple camera feeds simultaneously.

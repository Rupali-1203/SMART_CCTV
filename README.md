Sure, let's create a README file for your SMART_CCTV project on GitHub.

Here's a sample README file:

# SMART_CCTV
## OpenCV Project

### Introduction
SMART_CCTV is a project designed to enhance traditional CCTV systems by integrating advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to provide intelligent surveillance capabilities.

### Features
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV for detecting objects in video feeds.
- **Motion Detection:** Detects and highlights motion in the video stream.
- **Alert System:** Sends notifications when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Video Recording:** Records video footage and stores it for later review.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:** 
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn

### Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rupali-1203/SMART_CCTV.git
   cd SMART_CCTV
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Application:
   ```sh
   python SMART_CCTV.py
   ```

### How it Works
- **Object Detection:** The system uses pre-trained models from OpenCV to identify objects in the camera feed.
- **Motion Detection:** By comparing frames, the system detects any movement in the monitored area.
- **Alert System:** The system can be configured to send alerts via email or other notification systems when certain criteria are met.

### Example Usage
- Use SMART_CCTV to monitor restricted areas and receive real-time alerts on suspicious activities.

### Steps to Add README to Your Repository
1. Save the above content in a file named `README.md`.
2. Navigate to your project directory where you have cloned the SMART_CCTV repository.
3. Move the `README.md` file to this directory.
4. Run the following commands to add, commit, and push the README file to your GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Added README file"
   git push origin master
   ```

This will add a README file to your GitHub repository, providing a detailed yet concise overview of your SMART_CCTV project.
